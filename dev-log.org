* idea notebook
- login
- checktype: 
  - qt grab info, send to server
  - server check the database info, checktype, add stu and teacher, 
    and their number, into vector, teacher first.
  - server send the result type
  - qt respond in gui
- audio:
  - teacher give sig to server 
  - server give sig to stu (set a variable true)
  - qt check the variable by time, start streaming
  - stream to server
  - foreach Socket* not self, push
  - everyone receive audio msg by time, play
- video:
  - teacher stream to server
  - foreach Socket* not teacher, push
  - every stu receive video msg by time, play


* log
- <2020-04-21 周二> install Qt.
- <2020-04-29 周三> sqlite & c++, sql server
- <2020-05-05 周二> 
  login operation,
  database op commands over socket
- <2020-06-16 周二> 
  - random roll call, stuck in the audio transmission from stu to teacher.
  - teacher broadcast: complete
- <2020-06-18 周四>
  - screen sharing
  - push & ans problems
  - sign in & record
  - All functions done
  - to be optimized

  - optimized.
- <2020-06-20 周六>
  - corrected one problem existed in =THUnderClient (Admin mode)=
  - added assistant project =DbTranslator=

  - decoupling:
    - half done (teacher mode done, stu mode todo)

    - all done.
  - annotations done
- <2020-06-21 周日 0:50>
  - fixed a potential error in =Client::checktype=
- <2020-06-21 周日 14:26>
  - fixed a potential error in =StuMainPage::pull_prob=
  - fixed the problem that non-offline students' records wouldn't be showed
- <2020-06-21 周日 18:57>
  - fixed problem that server exceptionally exit if password isn't right

** Notebook
*** signal-slot
- signal :: the message sent
- slot :: the function called with respect to the signal.
- =connect= ::
  #+begin_src cpp
  QObject::connect(sender, SIGNAL(signal()), receiver, SLOT(slot()));
  #+end_src
- one =SIGNAL= can be connected to multiple =SLOT= s\\
  multiple =SIGNAL= s can be connected to one =SLOT=
- =SIGNAL= can connect to =SIGNAL=
*** project files
- MainWindow.h :: 定义窗口的头文件
- MainWindow.cpp :: 功能实现
  #+begin_src cpp
  #include "ui_MainWindow.h"
  #+end_src

- MainWindow.ui :: 窗体界面文件，包括各个组件的属性和布局
- ui_MainWindow.h :: 根据组件及其属性、信号与槽的关联，在 *编译* 时自动生成的类定义，
  类名为 =Ui_MainWindow=

*** attention
- 在 =MainWindow= 类中访问其成员变量、函数时要借由指针 =ui= ，如
  #+begin_src cpp
  ui->setupUi(this);
  #+end_src

*** button
- to check a button's event: check its =!checked= signal.

** extra: flatten design

* sqlite

* problem shooting
** connecting =SIGNAL(pressed())= and =SLOT=, in slot check =isDown()=
guess: =SIGNAL= is deleted once activated and passed, so the =isChecked= cannot 
catch the "press" process and cannot judge true.

** constructors may not be cv-qualified
constructors cannot be modified as =const=.
** 无法解析的外部符号
可能需要
#+begin_src cpp
#pragma comment (lib, "ws2_32.lib")
#+end_src
** cmake: build.make 57: Error 1
tryna use cmd to process the =make= and got error:
#+begin_src sh
The file includes the uic file "./ui_loginpage.h",
but the user interface file "loginpage.ui"
could not be found in the following locations
  "D:/THU/Lessons/1B/Cpp/THUnder/src/THUnderClient/view/loginpage.ui"
  "D:/THU/Lessons/1B/Cpp/THUnder/src/THUnderClient/view/./loginpage.ui"
#+end_src
so when using cmake, maybe =.ui= file should be in the same path with 
auto-generated =ui-xxx.h= file.
** undefined reference to XXX (some func in Socket)
#+begin_src text
cmake: target_link_libraries(THUnderServer -lwsock32)
qmake: LIBS += -lws2_32
#+end_src
** multiple definition of 'vsnprintf'
old problem of MinGW, already fixed in newest releases.
** jump case label
不要在case里定义变量
** 看上去是缺头文件的错误
如： =Adminop is not declared= \\
可能是头文件相互包含了
** undefined reference to winmain
change the main func a little bit then correct it back
** 字体异常
尝试删除字体，重启qt解决
** 在线程函数里不要new widget/dialog
- emit a signal out.
